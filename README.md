# React ColorPalette
This is a simple colorpalette project from Colt's React js course. It allows for creation of custom color palettes for ui designers and designers for selecting colors for their project. It is a lightweight clone of a popular color website "flatuicolors.com".

#Technology Used:
react, chroma js(color library), react hooks, react router, jss(css in js), material ui

#Objective of the Project
The main objective of this project was to familiarise with the workflow of react projects and cement the foundational learning of react. Also this project would serve as a color picker for my future projects.

#Future for the project:
Maybe expand the project to create gradients for css.
